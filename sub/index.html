                    <p>Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process for tech professionals it's a highly focused and rigorous process that assesses your technical skills, personality, and problem-solving abilities. In the same vein as "show, don't tell," you need to demonstrate your skills to the interviewer, rather than just stating them. The purpose of a technical interview isn't to trick you with riddles, brainteasers, or impossible questions, but rather to see how you tackle real-world problems, such as those you may encounter once you get hired. For the majority of us, technical interviews are a nightmare come true (with 3-4 interview rounds, remote coding challenges, and even full-day onsite interviews).If you are a fresher, typically you have 1 or 2 rounds. Even though they are intimidating, it is much easier when you know what to expect and have invested time into interview preparation.</p>
